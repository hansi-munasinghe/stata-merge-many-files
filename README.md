# stata-merge-many-files
* Syntax for merging many stata datasets 
*==============================================================================

* STEPS:
* Save all datasets you want merged in one folder
* start with first dataset (call this building)
* merge next file onto it, save 
* keep going through list of all files

* TIPS:
* Make sure all datasets have the same unique ID
* Because this involves opening and saving many times, consider working locally (VPN gave out for me)
